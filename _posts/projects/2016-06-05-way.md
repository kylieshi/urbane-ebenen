    caption: Citywide view showing bike trajectories

Three high-resolution screens show the space of flows of New York City, Berlin, and London through visualizing bike sharing systems of these world cities. By showing the flow of multiple cities side by side, we can compare their extent and dynamics. Tracing urban movements accentuates different urban structures, and contrasts grid-plan cities like New York with historically grown cities such as Berlin. It also enables us to observe and dwell on similarities and differences in various bike-sharing systems. With our visualizations we want to understand the pulse of urban mobility, and create portraits of a city defined by its transient dynamics.


## Visualization Design
*cf. city flows* has three viewing modes, all visualizing trips of rented bikes, but focusing on different levels of spatial and temporal granularity of cycling mobility:

* The citywide view aggregates all trajectories of bike-sharing trips for a given day and animates the trails for trips at a given time.
* In the station view only the bike trips to and from a selected station are shown, allowing the distinction between incoming and outgoing.
* A small-multiple view visualizes spatiotemporal patterns for three selected stations each in an exploded view that separates incoming from outgoing and morning from afternoon/evening trips.

## Design Process
In our process of exploring the bike data, and designing the visualizations we created lots of visual experiments. Some of those we share below.
